For this exploration I wanted to explore covid numbers in the United States by state (because of course that hasn't been done enough)

Downloaded a dataset/csv from the CDC containing information on United States Covid Numbers
	'https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36/data'

Date range for the dataset - 2020-01-20 - 2022-10-18

Imported the dataset into Excel and reviewed

Filtered and ordered by multiple attributes to better understand

Deleted the following attibutes not relevant to the exploration I decided on
	"conf_case", "prob_case", "pnew_case", "conf_death", "prob_death", "pnew_death", "created_at",	"consent_cases", "consent_deaths";

Left with the following attributes
	"date", "state", "total_cases", "new_cases", "total_deaths", "new_deaths";

Filtered the "states" column and noticed several American territories I will not include during analysis. I will filter out in PostgreSQL
 
Decided to leave in "DC" (District of Columbia)

New York State "NY" and New York City "NYC" are counted separately
	Will update "NYC" as "NY" and combine the additional "NY" information on the 'submission_date' column in PostgreSQL

Filtered "new_case" and found 27 occurences of a negative case count
	Researched the orginal documentation on the dataset and found a reference to adjustments made to "new_case" counts as well as "new_death" counts
	Chose to leave them in the data set to not cause discepencies during queries
	Will remove obvious outliers during any visualizations

Confirmed no "blanks"

Formatted columns new_cases, total_cases, new_deaths, and total_deaths as a Number with no comma separator and no decimal places

Final filter by 'date' and saved as "us_covid.csv"

Created a table in SQL and uploaded CSV
	CREATE TABLE us_covid (
	  date DATE,
	  state VARCHAR(50),
	  new_cases BIGINT,
	  total_cases BIGINT,
	  new_deaths BIGINT,
	  total_deaths BIGINT
	);

Confirmed successful upload
	SELECT *
	FROM US_COVID
	ORDER BY date DESC
	LIMIT 100;
  
Additional exploration and cleaning of the data
	SELECT DISTINCT STATE
	FROM US_COVID;
	**Returned 60 rows**

Deleting all of the American territories
	DELETE
	FROM US_COVID
	WHERE STATE IN ('GU','FSM','RMI','MP','VI','PR','AS','PW');

"NYC" AND "NY" are still separated
	UPDATE US_COVID
	SET STATE = 'NY'
	WHERE STATE = 'NYC';

Updating the table to combine the additional "NY" in the state column on the 'date' column
   and producing a table with the final 50 states and the District of columbia grouping by the
   date and state column in desceding order by date and then total deaths
   
WITH CTE AS
	(SELECT date
	 	,state
	 	,SUM(TOTAL_DEATHS) AS TOTAL_DEATH_SUM
		,SUM(NEW_DEATHS) AS NEW_DEATHS_SUM
		,SUM(TOTAL_CASES) AS TOTAL_CASES_SUM
		,SUM(NEW_CASES) AS NEW_CASES_SUM
	FROM US_COVID
/*      WHERE STATE = 'NY' *a check to confirm total_deaths matched 
	 	excel 'NY' and 'NYC' total deaths when combined (71577)
*/
	GROUP BY state
    		,date)
SELECT date
	,state
	,TOTAL_DEATH_SUM AS TOTAL_DEATHS
	,NEW_DEATHS_SUM AS NEW_DEATHS
	,TOTAL_CASES_SUM AS TOTAL_CASES
	,NEW_CASES_SUM AS NEW_CASES
FROM CTE
GROUP BY date
	,state
	,TOTAL_DEATH_SUM
	,NEW_DEATHS_SUM
	,TOTAL_CASES_SUM
	,NEW_CASES_SUM
ORDER BY date desc
	,total_deaths desc;

Saved output as new_us_covid.csv

Created a new table 'new_us_covid' in PostgreSQL (inherited columns from previous table)

Imported new_us_covid.csv

Confirmed import
	SELECT *
	FROM NEW_US_COVID
	LIMIT 100;
