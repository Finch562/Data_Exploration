## downloaded a dataset/csv from the CDC containing information on United States Covid Numbers

## 'https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36/data'

## date range for the dataset - 20200120 - 20221018

## imported the dataset into Excel and reviewed

## filtered and ordered by multiple attributes to better understand
  ## deleted the following attibutes not relevant to the exploration I decided on
    ## "conf_case", "prob_case", "pnew_case", "conf_death", "prob_death", "pnew_death", "created_at",	"consent_cases", "consent_deaths";
  ## left with the following attributes
    ## "date", "state",	"total_cases", "new_cases",	"total_deaths",	"new_deaths";

## Filtered the "states" column and noticed several American territories I will not include during analysis. I will filter out in PostgreSQL
 
## Decided to leave in "DC" (District of Columbia)
## New York State "NY" and New York City "NYC" are counted separately.
  ## Will update "NYC" as "NY" and combine the additional "NY" information on the 'submission_date' column in PostgreSQL

## Filtered "new_case" and found 27 occurences of a negative case count
  ## researched the orginal documentation on the dataset and found a reference to adjustments made to "new_case" counts as well as "new_death" counts
  ## chose to leave them in the data set to not cause discepencies during queries
  ## will remove obvious outliers during any visualizations

## Confirmed no "blanks"

## Formatted columns new_cases, total_cases, new_deaths, and total_deaths as a Number with no comma separator and no decimal places

## Final filter by 'date' and saved as' "us_covid.csv"

## Created a table in SQL and uploaded CSV
CREATE TABLE us_covid (
  date DATE,
  state VARCHAR(50),
  new_cases BIGINT,
  total_cases BIGINT,
  new_deaths BIGINT,
  total_deaths BIGINT
);

## Confirmed successful upload
  SELECT *
  FROM US_COVID
  ORDER BY date DESC
  LIMIT 100;
  
## Additional exploration and cleaning of the data
  SELECT DISTINCT STATE
  FROM US_COVID;
    Returned 60 rows

## Deleting all of the American territories
  DELETE
  FROM US_COVID
  WHERE STATE IN ('GU','FSM','RMI','MP','VI','PR','AS','PW');
 
## "NYC" AND "NY" are still separated
  UPDATE US_COVID
  SET STATE = 'NY'
  WHERE STATE = 'NYC';

## Updating the table to combine the additional "NY" in the state column on the 'date' column
   and producing a table with the final 50 states and the District of columbia grouping by the
   date and state column in desceding order by date and then total deaths.
