Accenture Social Buzz Content Analysis:

An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity


My Cleaned Dataset:

Documenting the process and steps I took:

Datasets:

•	‘Content’ - CSV
  •	We trust the data source from Social Buzz and do not feel the need to verify the “Type” or “Category” of the data against the URL source. *URL column     deleted*
  •	“Type” Column Clean
  •	“Category Column”
    •	Roughly half of the descriptions have quotes(“”) around them. “Find and replace” was used in Excel to remove the quotes(“”) from the entire column.       *34 changes were made*
    •	A significant number of rows were capitalized while the rest were not.
      Formula “=LOWER(E1)” was used to copy the column over in all lower case. The column was then copied and pasted with values only. Original column        was deleted.
    •	“USER ID” column was deleted as we will not be do an in-depth analysis on which users liked what type of content at this time.

•	‘Reactions’ - CSV
   • The “Type” column had 981 “Blanks”. Because we are looking for the most popular content by type, these incomplete rows were not useful and deleted.
   • A remaining 2039 “User ID”s were missing – we determined that should not affect the reaction type data, so the missing “User ID”s were kept.
   • After further review of our objective, the “USER ID” column was deleted as we will not be doing an in-depth analysis on which users liked what type      of content at this time.
   
•	‘Reaction Types’ - CSV
   • No errors found. Reaction types matched the list of types from the “Reaction” table.

•	We are left with the following datasets to work with:
  •	'Reactions'
    	Content ID
    	Type
      Datetime
    
  •	'Content'
	    Content ID
	    Content Type
	    Category
      
	• 'ReactionType'
      Type
      Sentiment
      Score

I combined the 'Content' and 'ReactionType' datasets with the 'Reactions' dataset in Excel.

Using XLOOKUP to create a single sheet/dataset with the all of the information we need for the analysis.
  •	Importing the Content Type data from the Content dataset
    '=XLOOKUP(B1,Content!B:B,Content!C:C,Content!C:C,0)’
  •	Importing the Category data from the Content dataset
    ‘=XLOOKUP(B1,Content!B:B,Content!D:D,Content!D:D,0)’
  •	Importing the Category data from the Content dataset
    ‘=XLOOKUP(C2,ReactionType!B:B,ReactionType!D:D,ReactionType!B:B,0)’


Copied each column and pasted values only to remove the formulas.


Determining the top 5 Categories.
  •	Created a “Categories” column in column H
  • Extracted the distinct categories from row F and input them starting at H2
    '=INDEX($F$2:$F$24574,MATCH(0,COUNTIF($H$1:H1,$F$2:$F$24574),0))'

•	Created a “Total Score” Column in row I
    'Summed the score column based on the new “Categories” column and the “Category” column
    '=SUMIFS(G:G,F:F,@H:H)'

•	Applied a filter to the “Categories” and “Total Score” column and sorted based on the “Total Score” column in descending order

•	Created a “Top 5 Categories” column. Copied and pasted the top 5 results from the “Categories” column.

***Decided it would be a much cleaner document by moving the new columns to their own sheet***
